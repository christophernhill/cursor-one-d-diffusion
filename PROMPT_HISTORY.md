# Prompt History and Responses

## Prompt 1: Initial Implementation
**Exact Prompt**:
```
I would like to write some python code to explcitly step forward a one-dimensional diffusion equation on a discrete grid. I would like the discrete coordinate to be called "z", and the diffused variable to be called "theta". The diffusion coeeficient should be called "kappa". It should be able to vary with "z" and it should take different values depending on whether theta is above or below some threshold.
```

**Response**: Created `diffusion_solver.py` with:
- `DiffusionSolver` class implementing explicit time-stepping
- Support for spatially varying kappa
- Threshold-based kappa selection
- Neumann boundary conditions
- Vectorized NumPy implementation

## Prompt 2: GPU/CPU Acceleration
**Exact Prompt**:
```
can you also add some jax code so that the python can run efficiently on wither a GPU or a CPU.
```

**Response**: Modified `diffusion_solver.py` to:
- Replace NumPy with JAX's NumPy
- Add JIT compilation for performance
- Use JAX's immutable array operations
- Add automatic GPU acceleration
- Maintain compatibility with both NumPy and JAX arrays

## Prompt 3: Test Driver and Visualization
**Exact Prompt**:
```
can you set up a test driver that initializes a temperature profile that is linear in z and start at -10 and ends at +10. can you generate code to create two jpegs of plots of theta against z, one for the initial theta profile and one for the final profile after 1000 time steps. the profile plots should have theta on the x-axis and z on the y-axis.
```

**Response**: Created `test_diffusion.py` with:
- Linear temperature initialization
- Matplotlib visualization
- Side-by-side plots of initial and final states
- Statistics printing
- JPEG output of plots

## Prompt 4: Stability Fix
**Exact Prompt**:
```
hmm - when I ran the test I got NaNs for the final state. Can you check the code, or maybe the timestep is unstable. The result should be within the initial minimum and maximum range for Neumann boundary conditions.
```

**Response**: Modified the code to:
- Calculate stable time step based on grid spacing and max kappa
- Add safety factor to time step calculation
- Add NaN detection and warning
- Ensure solution stays within physical bounds

## Prompt 5: Memory Optimization
**Exact Prompt**:
```
can you change the code so only the first and last steps are saved in the history. Right now it is eacting up a lot of memory when it runs.
```

**Response**: Modified `run_simulation` method to:
- Store only initial and final states
- Remove intermediate state storage
- Maintain same visualization capabilities
- Significantly reduce memory footprint

## Prompt 6: Vertical Average Calculation
**Exact Prompt**:
```
can you add code to calculate the vertically averaged value of theta
```

**Response**: Added:
- `vertical_average` method to `DiffusionSolver` class
- Vertical average visualization in plots
- Statistics about average values
- Verification of conservation properties

## Prompt 7: Documentation
**Exact Prompt**:
```
can you generate a text file called "PROMPT_HISTORY.md" that has each of the prompts we have used so far and then summarizes the responses to those propmts.
```

**Response**: Created `PROMPT_HISTORY.md` documenting:
- Chronological history of prompts
- Summary of responses
- Evolution of the code
- Current state of the project

## Prompt 8: README Creation
**Exact Prompt**:
```
Can you also generate a README.md that explains what this projects code does.
```

**Response**: Created `README.md` with:
- Project overview
- Features list
- Mathematical formulation
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Component descriptions
- Performance considerations
- Visualization details
- Conservation properties

## Prompt 9: GitHub Setup
**Exact Prompt**:
```
Great - can you create the commands to make this code suitable for adding to the empty git repository git@github.com:christophernhill/cursor-one-d-diffusion.git and then generate commands to upload to the repository.
```

**Response**: Set up Git repository with:
- Initialized local repository
- Created `.gitignore` file
- Added remote repository
- Added and committed all files
- Pushed to GitHub
