# Prompt History and Responses

## Prompt 1: Initial Implementation
**User Request**: Write Python code to explicitly step forward a one-dimensional diffusion equation on a discrete grid with:
- Discrete coordinate called "z"
- Diffused variable called "theta"
- Diffusion coefficient called "kappa" that varies with "z" and depends on theta being above/below a threshold

**Response**: Created `diffusion_solver.py` with:
- `DiffusionSolver` class implementing explicit time-stepping
- Support for spatially varying kappa
- Threshold-based kappa selection
- Neumann boundary conditions
- Vectorized NumPy implementation

## Prompt 2: GPU/CPU Acceleration
**User Request**: Add JAX code to make the Python run efficiently on both GPU and CPU.

**Response**: Modified `diffusion_solver.py` to:
- Replace NumPy with JAX's NumPy
- Add JIT compilation for performance
- Use JAX's immutable array operations
- Add automatic GPU acceleration
- Maintain compatibility with both NumPy and JAX arrays

## Prompt 3: Test Driver and Visualization
**User Request**: Create a test driver that:
- Initializes a linear temperature profile from -10 to +10
- Generates plots of theta against z
- Shows initial and final profiles after 1000 steps

**Response**: Created `test_diffusion.py` with:
- Linear temperature initialization
- Matplotlib visualization
- Side-by-side plots of initial and final states
- Statistics printing
- JPEG output of plots

## Prompt 4: Stability Fix
**User Request**: Fix NaN values appearing in the solution.

**Response**: Modified the code to:
- Calculate stable time step based on grid spacing and max kappa
- Add safety factor to time step calculation
- Add NaN detection and warning
- Ensure solution stays within physical bounds

## Prompt 5: Memory Optimization
**User Request**: Reduce memory usage by only saving first and last steps.

**Response**: Modified `run_simulation` method to:
- Store only initial and final states
- Remove intermediate state storage
- Maintain same visualization capabilities
- Significantly reduce memory footprint

## Prompt 6: Vertical Average Calculation
**User Request**: Add code to calculate vertically averaged value of theta.

**Response**: Added:
- `vertical_average` method to `DiffusionSolver` class
- Vertical average visualization in plots
- Statistics about average values
- Verification of conservation properties
