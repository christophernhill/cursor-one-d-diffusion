# Background Notes

## Europa Surface Flux Estimation

The energy flux from Europa's surface can be estimated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation:

F = σT⁴

where:
- F is the energy flux (W/m²)
- σ (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.670374419 × 10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴
- T is the temperature in Kelvin

### Calculation for -150°C Surface Temperature

1. Convert -150°C to Kelvin:
   T = -150°C + 273.15 = 123.15 K

2. Apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   F = (5.670374419 × 10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴) × (123.15 K)⁴
   (123.15)⁴ ≈ 2.30 × 10⁸ K⁴
   F ≈ 5.670374419 × 10⁻⁸ × 2.30 × 10⁸
   F ≈ 13.04 W/m²

### Context and Comparison

- Europa's surface flux (13.04 W/m²) is significantly lower than:
  - Room temperature (20°C): ~418.6 W/m²
  - Earth's average temperature (15°C): ~390.1 W/m²
  - Sun's surface temperature (5778 K): ~63.2 MW/m²

This low surface flux is consistent with Europa's position in the outer solar system and its primarily icy surface composition.

### Observational Data

The Galileo spacecraft's Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR) instrument measured Europa's surface temperatures during its mission. These measurements show that midday temperatures at Europa's equator reach about -225°F (130 K), with even colder temperatures toward the poles and during non-midday periods. The temperature variations across the surface are influenced by surface albedo, with darker regions absorbing more sunlight and appearing warmer than brighter regions.
